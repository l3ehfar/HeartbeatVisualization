# HeartbeatVisualization

This project is followed by a research on Piezo Electric Device, a research assigned by the Signals and Systems Course of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. 

[What is Piezoelectricity](https://github.com/l3ehfar/HeartbeatVisualization/blob/main/description/Piezoelectricity.pdf)
[Analysis on heartbeats' frame rate and amplitude](https://github.com/l3ehfar/HeartbeatVisualization/blob/main/description/Audio%20Spectrum.pdf)

then I'd made a handemade Piezo device which have been used in two interactive projects. I simply get electric signals which had been converted from mechanical energy with this device and used it as an input for my interactive projects.

The so-called Heartbeat Visualization project is a visualization of my bestfriend's heartbeat. 
you can watch it here:
